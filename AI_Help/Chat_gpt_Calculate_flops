Estimate the FLOPs for one forward pass of your Transformer model. (Hint: major cost comes from QKᵀ  
matmuls, softmax, and MLP matmuls.) 
ChatGPT:
Sure! Let’s carefully estimate the **FLOPs (floating point operations)** for one forward pass of your Transformer model. I’ll assume your model parameters from earlier:

* **Layers:** 4
* **Hidden size:** 256
* **Heads:** 4
* **Sequence length:** 128
* **Feed-forward expansion factor:** 4 → FF hidden size = 256 × 4 = 1024
* **Vocab size:** (V) (we’ll leave symbolic)

---

### Step 1: Token + Positional Embeddings

* Each input token (length (T = 128)) is mapped to a vector of size (d = 256)
* **Embedding lookup FLOPs:** negligible compared to matmuls.

---

### Step 2: Multi-Head Self-Attention (per layer)

1. **Q, K, V projections:**

* Each is a linear layer: (d \times d = 256 \times 256)
* There are 3 projections per token, total FLOPs:
  [
  \text{FLOPs_QKV} = 3 \times T \times d^2 = 3 \times 128 \times 256^2
  ]

Compute:

* (256^2 = 65536)
* Multiply by 128 → 65536 × 128 = 8,388,608
* Multiply by 3 → 25,165,824 FLOPs

✅ So **~25.2M FLOPs for QKV projections per layer**.

---

2. **Attention scores (QKᵀ)**

* Q and K are split into **h = 4 heads**, each of size (d_h = d/h = 64)
* For one head: (T \times T \times d_h = 128 × 128 × 64 = 1,048,576) multiply-adds (each multiply-add ≈ 2 FLOPs) → ~2,097,152 FLOPs per head
* 4 heads → 8,388,608 FLOPs

✅ So **QKᵀ FLOPs ≈ 8.39M per layer**

---

3. **Softmax**

* Softmax per token involves exponentials + normalization across (T = 128) tokens
* Rough estimate: 5 FLOPs per element (exp + sum + div)
* Total elements: (T × T × h = 128 × 128 × 4 = 65,536)
* FLOPs ≈ 65,536 × 5 ≈ 327,680

✅ Softmax cost is small compared to matmuls (~0.3M FLOPs)

---

4. **Attention × V**

* Each head: (T × T × d_h = 128 × 128 × 64) → 1,048,576 × 2 FLOPs ≈ 2,097,152
* 4 heads → 8,388,608 FLOPs

5. **Output projection**

* Linear layer: (T × d × d = 128 × 256 × 256 = 8,388,608) FLOPs

---

**Total self-attention per layer:**

| Component     | FLOPs  |
| ------------- | ------ |
| QKV proj      | 25.17M |
| QKᵀ           | 8.39M  |
| softmax       | 0.33M  |
| attention × V | 8.39M  |
| output proj   | 8.39M  |
| **Total**     | ~50.7M |

---

### Step 3: Feed-Forward Network (per layer)

* Two linear layers:

1. (d → 4d = 256 → 1024) → 128 tokens × 256 × 1024 × 2 FLOPs (multiply + add)

* Compute: 128 × 256 × 1024 × 2 = 67,108,864 FLOPs

2. (4d → d = 1024 → 256) → 128 × 1024 × 256 × 2 = 67,108,864 FLOPs

✅ FFN per layer ≈ 134.2M FLOPs

---

### Step 4: LayerNorm / RMSNorm

* ~2 × d FLOPs per token per layer (multiplication + addition)
* Very small compared to matmuls → negligible (~65k FLOPs per layer)

---

### Step 5: Total per layer

* Self-attention ≈ 50.7M
* FFN ≈ 134.2M
* **Layer total ≈ 185M FLOPs**

4 layers → 185M × 4 ≈ 740M FLOPs

---

### Step 6: Final linear layer to vocab

* Linear layer: (T × d × V = 128 × 256 × V) multiply-adds → 128 × 256 × V × 2 FLOPs ≈ 65,536 × V FLOPs

* For **tiny Shakespeare**, (V ≈ 65) → 65,536 × 65 ≈ 4.26M FLOPs

---

### ✅ Step 7: Total forward pass

[
\text{Total FLOPs} ≈ 740M + 4.26M ≈ 744M FLOPs
]

> Rounded, **≈ 0.74 GFLOPs** per forward pass for one sequence of 128 tokens.

---

**Summary Table**

| Component                 | FLOPs (approx)  |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Self-Attention (4 layers) | 203M × 4 = 740M |
| FFN (4 layers)            | 134M × 4 = 536M |
| Final linear (to vocab)   | 4.3M            |
| **Total**                 | ~744M           |

> Note: We approximated multiply-add as 2 FLOPs. LayerNorm and softmax are negligible.

If you want, I can **also estimate FLOPs for one training step** (forward + backward) — it’s roughly **6×** the forward pass.

Do you want me to do that?
Me:
Estimate the memory footprint (weights + activations) for your model. 
Chat GPT:
Sure! Let’s carefully estimate the **memory footprint** of your Transformer model in terms of **weights and activations**, based on the parameters you gave:

* **Layers:** 4
* **Hidden size:** 256
* **Heads:** 4
* **Seq length:** 128
* **Feed-forward expansion:** 4 → FFN hidden size = 1024
* **Vocab size:** (V \approx 65)

We’ll assume **float32 (4 bytes per number)**.

## 1️⃣ Weights

### (a) Embeddings

* Token embedding: `vocab_size × d` → 65 × 256 = 16,640
* Positional embedding: `max_seq_len × d` → 128 × 256 = 32,768
* Total embedding weights: 16,640 + 32,768 ≈ **49,408 floats** → 49,408 × 4 bytes ≈ **0.2 MB**

---

### (b) Self-Attention weights (per layer)

* Q, K, V projections: `3 × d × d` → 3 × 256 × 256 = 196,608
* Output projection: `d × d = 256 × 256 = 65,536`
* Total per layer: 196,608 + 65,536 ≈ 262,144
* 4 layers → 262,144 × 4 = 1,048,576 floats → 1,048,576 × 4 bytes ≈ **4 MB**

---

### (c) Feed-Forward Network weights (per layer)

* First linear: `d × 4d = 256 × 1024 = 262,144`

| -------------- | ------------- |
| Embeddings     | 0.2           |
| Self-Attention | 4             |
| FFN            | 8             |
| Final linear   | 0.06          |
| **Total**      | **≈ 12.3 MB** |

> So the **model parameters alone** fit in ~12 MB.

## 2️⃣ Activations

Activations dominate memory during training. We’ll compute **per layer** and include sequence length and batch size. Assume **batch_size = 64**.

### (a) Embedding output

* `batch_size × seq_len × d = 64 × 128 × 256 = 2,097,152` floats → 8.39 MB

---

### (b) Self-Attention activations

* Q, K, V: same size as embedding → 3 × 2,097,152 = 6,291,456 → 25.2 MB
* Attention scores (QKᵀ): `batch × heads × seq × seq = 64 × 4 × 128 × 128 = 4,194,304` → 16.8 MB
* Attention output: `batch × seq × d = 2,097,152` → 8.39 MB

✅ Total attention activations per layer ≈ 50.3 MB

---

### (c) Feed-Forward activations

* First linear: `batch × seq × 4d = 64 × 128 × 1024 = 8,388,608` → 32 MB
* Second linear: `batch × seq × d = 2,097,152` → 8.39 MB

✅ FFN activations per layer ≈ 40.4 MB

---

### (d) Total activations per layer

* 50.3 + 40.4 ≈ 90.7 MB
* 4 layers → 90.7 × 4 ≈ 362.8 MB

---

### (e) Final linear layer output

* `batch × seq × vocab_size = 64 × 128 × 65 = 532,480` → 2.1 MB

---

### ✅ Total activation memory (forward pass)

* Embeddings: 8.4 MB
* Layers: 362.8 MB
* Final linear: 2.1 MB

**Total ≈ 373 MB**

> During **training**, activations need to be stored for backward pass, so actual memory footprint ~2× forward activations → ~746 MB

---

## 3️⃣ Total GPU memory (weights + activations)

| Component                 | Size    |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| Weights                   | 12 MB   |
| Forward activations       | 373 MB  |
| Backward activations      | ~373 MB |
| **Total training memory** | ~746 MB |

> Forward-only inference requires only ~373 MB + 12 MB ≈ 385 MB

---

### ✅ Summary

* **Weights:** ~12 MB
* **Forward activations:** ~373 MB
* **Training (forward + backward):** ~746 MB
* **Inference:** ~385 MB

---

If you want, I can also **break down memory per attention head** and per FFN layer to see which part dominates most — helpful for **GPU optimization**.

Do you want me to do that?


Double checking the outputs they seemed to be correct which is why I included them in the report.
