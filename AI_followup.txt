Claude I thought would work better than it did. It produced what seemed to be really good code with lots of explanations
but it failed to actually work. The training worked, but generating the text did not. And attempts to fix the code
did not work.

The chatgpt solution got me close to what I was looking for. I took what it produced and made the three files from it, train,
generate and model.py.

Overall I was impressed with how quickly they were able to produce output of programs and how high quality they were.
From what I had heard, I was expecting Claude to be  better since it is more focused on code, but the ChatGPT
solution seemed to work better (by actually being runable).
